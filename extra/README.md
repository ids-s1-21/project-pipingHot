Do factors such as age, hypertension and BMI increase the risk of a stroke?

We got our dataset from the Kaggle website. The data was collected confidentially because it concerns health of real people so the details about its collection have not been published. Each case is a different individual. 

The 12 variables are; the unique identifier of the patent, their gender,  age, if they have hypertension, heart desiese, are they married, their type of work, where they live average glucose level, their BMI, smoking statuse, and if they have had a stroke. 

Minuets of project time. 
sesion 1
- we picked xraingan as our template

- listen to Disney (better than opera)
session 2
-remove other in gender only one instance. 
- males 5.0 
- female 4.7
- married and age.
- possible correlation to avg_glucose, bmi
-blood glucose (mg/dl)



presentation notes

On this density graph the two ridges peak into different places. Firstly, they peak at an average glucose level of 80mg/dl, those who did not have a stroke peaked much higher than those who did have a stroke. The second peak peaked at an average glucose level of 210 mg/dl, those who did not have a stroke was a relatively low peak but those who did have a stroke leaked significantly higher than those who didnâ€™t. This shows a possible link between high blood glucose levels (anything about 180 mg/dl is considered high) and an increased stroke risk. (Diabetes.co.uk, 2019)  

The average age of the individuals who had a stroke is 71 years old but the average age of those who did not have a stroke id 22 years younger than those who did at 49 years old. This finding is consistent with the known and proven link between increased age and a higher stroke risk.
